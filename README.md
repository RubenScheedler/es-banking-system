# Event Sourcing Banking System
This project mimics a startup banking application. Features are added in an agile fashion. Functionalities include creating accounts, making deposits and withdrawals, and more. The system only consists of a backend, which exposes an API. It is written in Java/Spring (Boot) and relies on the [Axon framework](https://docs.axoniq.io/reference-guide/) and its server.

# Setup
```
docker-compose up
```

# Goals
- Practice event sourcing
- Try out the [Axon framework](https://docs.axoniq.io/reference-guide/)
- Practice CQRS
- Try out the project structure recommended by Axon (based on CQRS)
